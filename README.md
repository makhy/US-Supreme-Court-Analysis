# Analysis on the US Supreme Court Data

The U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) database contains myriad details on the judges' decisions since the formation of the court in 1791. 

In this repository, I use R packages to mine into the database. In particular, I built charts that visualise the following:

* 1) The percentage of SCOTUS cases that were decided by a one vote margin
* 2) The percentage of Justice Scalia's majority decisions throughout his term
* 3) The percentage of conservative decisions throughout the SCOTUS's history
* 4) The correlation between the Chief Justices and the ideological direction of the SCOTUS in their terms

This repository was written and submitted as part of the [assignment 03] (http://cfss.uchicago.edu/hw03-wrangle-data.html) for the [Computing for the Social Sciences class at Uchicago] (https://cfss.uchicago.edu).
