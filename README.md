# Analysis on the US Supreme Court Data

The [U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) database](http://scdb.wustl.edu) contains myriad details on the judges' decisions since the formation of the court in 1791. 

In this repository, I use R packages to mine into the database. In particular, I built charts that visualise the following:

* The percentage of SCOTUS cases that were decided by a one vote margin
* The percentage of Justice Scalia's majority decisions throughout his term
* The percentage of conservative decisions throughout the SCOTUS's history
* The correlation between the Chief Justices and the ideological direction of the SCOTUS in their terms

This repository was written and submitted as part of the [assignment 03](http://cfss.uchicago.edu/hw03-wrangle-data.html) for the [Computing for the Social Sciences class](https://cfss.uchicago.edu) at U Chicago.
